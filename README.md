# react-table

This little app illustrates that one can write a usefull React app using only plain html, javascript and css, without having to install anything!
A dumb terminal plus vi would do the job. More specifically, there's no need to have a fancy IDE or
a whole slew of things such as nested node_modules, JSX, ES6, Typescript, webpack, Sass, Babel, Browserify, Gulp or Flux.
